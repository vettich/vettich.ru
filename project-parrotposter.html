	<h2>A bit of history:</h2>
	<div>In 2016, a plugin was implemented for the popular CMS 1C-Bitrix. The plugin was written in PHP, and supported
		up to 8 social networks.</div>
	<div>In 2019, it became more difficult to deal with the support of the plugin, so it was decided to abandon further
		updates. The plugin moved to the abandoned status.</div>
	<div>In 2020, the idea arose to try to realize a web service that would serve as a core for the implementation of
		plugins for different CMS. The service was implemented using Go, Vue, RethinkDB and some JavaScript on the
		backend. A plugin for 1C-Bitrix was also developed using PHP.</div>
	<div>In 2022, a plugin for WordPress was developed.</div>
	<div>In 2023, the service was rewritten from Go to Rust, and from Vue to SvelteKit. Why. Because I can.</div>

	<h2>A bit of stats: </h2>
	<div>
		The service currently has over 3k registered users.
		<br>
		Of those, about 50 of them use a paid subscription.
		<br>
		And about 100 more have purchased a subscription at least once.
	</div>

	<h2>Future:</h2>
	<div>In general, I have ideas on how to further improve the service, but I'm not sure if I'll be actively involved
		in it yet.</div>
